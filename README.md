# Amasty Shopby for OpenMage / PHP 8

Adds OpenMage / PHP 8.2+ compatibility to Amasty's [Improved Layered Navigation](https://amasty.com/improved-layered-navigation.html) extension for Magento 1.

Depends: 
Amasty_Shopby

Installation:
1. Copy the contents of the "step1" directory to the docroot
2. Copy the contents of the "step2" directory to the docroot
3. Clear cache and reload

Caveats:
- You must already own the Improved Layered Navigation extension for Magento 1
- This was written for OpenMage, not Magento 1
- I don't work for Amasty
